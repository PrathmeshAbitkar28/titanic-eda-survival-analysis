# 🚢 Titanic EDA: Survival Analysis

A comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns behind passenger survival. This project focuses on uncovering key insights using Python and visualizations to support data-driven hypotheses.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** of the Titanic dataset.
- Explore and visualize key features impacting **passenger survival**.
- Identify **correlations and patterns** using statistical and visual tools.
- Build a foundation for future **predictive modeling**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

---

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Distribution of survival by **gender**, **passenger class**, **age**, and **family size**
- Impact of **fare**, **embarked location**, and **cabin availability**
- Correlation heatmaps to assess relationships between variables
- Handling of **missing data** and feature engineering (e.g., Title extraction from names)

---

## 📷 Sample Visuals
_Add screenshots or graphs here (e.g., survival rate bar plot, heatmap, etc.)_

---

## 🔍 Findings
- **Females** and **1st class passengers** had significantly higher survival rates.
- Younger passengers and those with smaller families were more likely to survive.
- Certain titles (e.g., “Master”, “Miss”) provided insight into age and social status.
